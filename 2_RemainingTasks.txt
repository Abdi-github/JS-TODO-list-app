***********

Presentation:
-------------
- Prepare Category and tasks (for urgency demo)
- Size of text of slide SV
- Remove unnecessary slides (agenda, Demo, ..?)
- Partie demo (qui ?)


General :
---------
- DONE : Create 0_Readme.txt file with information
- DONE : New task can only be in a category (not only in high Priority)
		Cannot add if we are in High Priority
		Adapt message ? Task could not be added directly under High priority category
- DONE : How to use Urgency value :
- DONE : Application name : TODO-List (in presentation and source)
- DONE : Adapt description in input fields two have same idea :
 	- Enter new category description
	- Enter new task description
	- Enter due date

In categories.js :
------------
 - DONE : Remove Localstorage function used (not used)
 - DONE : buildAndDisplay called too many times

In tasks.js :
------------
 - DONE : Actions (change High priority, add, remove) call informAboutTasksChanges();
 - DONE : Current method with AddTask create circular [Task] (see console) !!
 - DONE : If no description provided, do not add task (undefined description)
 - DONE : If task is removed from Priority, remove also from related category !
 - DONE : Create functions to add fake tasks in categories

Display :
---------
- On startup, remove list of categories (in projectstyle.js)
- DONE : Display High priority Category with more impact
- DONE : Display number of task on right side in state of (x)
		Better : Only tasks not completed !
- DONE : Adapt height of two Category buttons to the same look than for tasks
- DONE : Increase in task display the width of task description and reduce the width of due date.
- DONE : Move Category "Add" button to the right to align on the right
- DONE : Add a "Task" Header on the task side (like the Categories on the left side) with another color
		Nice to have : By selecting a categorie we could then display in this task header the categorie description selected
		Align on the same line the "Add" Categories inputs and buttons and the tasks inputs and buttons
- DONE : Remove border on Div (test how it looks like)
